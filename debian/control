Description: static library and header for web communication
 LibHTTPD can be used to add basic web server capabilities to an
 application or embedded device. The library handles both static and
 dynamically generated content, has very low overheads, and provides many
 features to simplify the creation of web based application interfaces.
 .
 The Hughes library saw last updates about a decade ago,
 but the community behind nodogsplash keeps it maintained as part
 of its source tree. Latest changes contributed e.g. IPv6 support.
